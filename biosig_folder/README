    biosig4python supports reading various biosignal dataformats into Python.
    Currently the following formats are supported: 
	EDF, BDF, GDF (v1 and v2)

    However, biosig4c++ provides (through) swig a much faster implemenation, 
    which supports more data formats, too. In other words, biosig4python is 
    obsolete and it is recommended to use biosig4c++ instead.
